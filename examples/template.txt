# 1. initialize(): Function to initialize settings and 
#    user defined parameters
# 2. ondata(): Function to define strategy logic 

# Intialize the strategy with various settings and/or parameters
function initialize(state)
	# Set intiial cash
	setcash(1000000.0)
	# Set Cancel policy to GTC (good till canceled)
	setcancelpolicy(CancelPolicy(GTC))
	# Set universe (mandatory before placing any orders)
	setuniverse(["TCS"])
end

# Define strategy logic here
# This function is called EVERY DAY
# However, the rebalance frequency can be 
function ondata(data, state)
	# Get Universe
	universe = getuniverse()
	
	# Set the holding in all stock in universe to 100 shares
	for stock in universe
		# Function is called every Day/Week/Month based on rebalance frequency
		setholdingpct(stock, 1.0)

	# Track the portfolio value
	track("portfoliovalue", state.account.netvalue)
